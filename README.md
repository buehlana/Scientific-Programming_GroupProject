# Stock Strategy comparison project 

This project analyzes two trading strategies ("Buy at Open, Sell at Close" vs "Buy at Close, Sell at Next Open") across five major stocks (AAPL, GME, GOOGL, META, NFLX) over the period November 2024 â€“ April 2025.
It collects real-world stock data, prepares it, saves it into a csv file, a SQLite database, performs statistical analyses (paired t-test, p-values), generates visualizations, and checks normality assumptions using QQ-plots.

## Features
1. Real-world data collection via Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)
2. Data cleaning, preparation, and validation (with regex)
3. Storage and retrieval from a SQLite database
4. QQ-plot analysis for normality checking
5. Statistical comparison of two trading strategies using paired t-tests
6. Multiple visualizations: profit plots, cumulative returns
7. Full codebase ready for local run (no external API keys needed)
